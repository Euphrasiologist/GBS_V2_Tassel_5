# Genotyping by Sequencing pipeline

Provided in this repository are shell scripts for a Genotyping by Sequencing analysis. The pipeline used is the Tassel 5 GBS version 2 which can be seen here:

The pipeline is reasonably straighforward and generates eventually a VCF containing genotypes and variants of all the taxa sampled.
